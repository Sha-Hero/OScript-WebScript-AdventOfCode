# WebScript-AdventOfCode-2023
My Advent of Code Solutions in WebScript for 2023

Note that these make the following assumptions:
- Each has been implemented as a WebReport in GCdocs
- Each has the input file as the WebReport source
- "Vanilla" permissions. That is, restricted to the default functions available in WebScripts

Restrictions/Quirks
- WebReports don't "run" linearly per-se. They interpret then display.
- All coding is done in OScript. There is some jQuery and HTML but that's only for displaying results.
- WebScript - you can't assign return values to a variable. Return values are only "displayable"
-   Remember - WebReports are primarily meant for prettifying output.

My approach is to solve the problems - not necessarily to be elegant or efficient. Just see if I can solve them given the tools available.
